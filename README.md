- File Handling (`fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`)
- Binary files
- Functions and modular programming
- Menu-driven programming

---

## Project Structure
- bank.c : source code
- bank.exe : compiled program
- bank.dat : data file created during execution
---

## How to Run

1. Open terminal in the `src` folder  
2. Compile the program: gcc bank.c -o bank

## Planned Enchancements

- Login and authentication system
- Transaction history logging using files
- Role-based menus (Admin and User)
- Improved error handling and input validation
- Fully modular code structure using `.c` and `.h` files
